		<h2>We wrote the book on website security.</h2>
		<section class="col-sm-6 section-pad-right-large">
			<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">We seriously did.</h4>
			<p>A short and easy-read by FatLab's founder Shane Larrabee that covers the basics of website security.</p>
			<p>We admit, it's written by a nerd, but you don't have to be a server geek to get it. The goal was to document in easy-to-understand terms the requirements of maintaining a secure (as possible) website.</p>
			<p>Use it as way to start a conversation with your current provider, or use it as a checklist to see how secure your website is today. Heck, print it out and use it as a coffee table book, we're just trying to be helpful.</p>
