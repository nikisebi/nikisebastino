				<p>We contacted FatLab after one of our client’s sites had come under attack and the current host had taken it offline. FatLab was able to stop the attack, get the site behind a firewall and provide stable hosting in a just a matter of hours. FatLab has remained incredible responsive to all of requests since that time.</p>
