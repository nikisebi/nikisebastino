					<p>Heck, if we are the ones to get a call when a site is offline, shouldn't we build the absolute best hosting platform we can rather than rely on someone else? So that is exactly what we did.

				<p>You don't have to piss someone off to become a target of hackers. Your site visitors could become victims of viruses (or maybe just pharmaceutical ads if they are lucky) if a random bad bot finds just one weak point in your site's code.</p>

				<p>This is where we come in. Utilizing realtime firewalls, daily malware scanning (and cleaning), full page caching, CDNs, code optimizations, and more - we can help ensure your site remains secure, safe and fast. This will protect your site visitors and ensure they have the absolute best experience possible.</p>
