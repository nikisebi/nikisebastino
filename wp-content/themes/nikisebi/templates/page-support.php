			<h1 class="section-pad" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500">Managed <span class="blue">Wordpress</span></h1>
			<p class="subhead">Many services claim to provide managed WordPress hosting services. However, they tend to fall short of what we consider to be truly “managed.” For many hosts, managed means that they may run some automated updates (who is checking that those went smoothly?); provide some performance and security focused services; and provide support as it relates to their hosting service. </p>
			<h2 class="section-pad" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500">Redefining <span class="blue">Managed</span></h2>
			<p>At FatLab we have redefined what “managed” in managed WordPress hosting means. Sure we provide a lot of the same security, performance and other services, but what makes us different is our approach to support.</p>
			<p>At no time will you ever contact us for support and hear the words “please contact your developer.” We not only support our hosting platform, we also support your individual site. If your site is having an issue we can look into it and advise on the best course of action. If the issue is hosting related we will absolutely take care of that. <strong class="text-black">It’s about keeping your site up, running and secure ... simple as that.</strong></p>
			<p>In fact, this is where the “Really Expensive” comes in. We are not full of automated systems, canned support responses, nor do we have a policy of quick dismissal of responsibility.</p>
			<p>It’s the human element that we are selling here. You will be on a first name basis with our team, we will get to know your site and we will know who you are and what site(s) you have with us when you contact us. Over time we’ll get faster and super efficient at working on your site. We use version control systems and offer a full (human run, no question/answer bots) support ticket system for full accountability.</p>
			<h2 class="section-pad" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500">Full <span class="blue">SSL/HTTPS</span> Support</h2>
			<p>We support full SSL/HTTPS website hosting with the certificate being installed at both the firewall and server levels for complete encryption to protect your site visitors.</p>
			<p>We offer many different SSL certificates a discounted prices and can advise and facilitate the issuance of a certificate for your website. Of course we take care of installation and configuration. We can also convert your WordPress website from standard HTTP to HTTPS. </p>
			<p>We highly advise that all sites run on SSL/HTTPS and typically mandate that one be used for the sites we host. Google and other big internet players feel the same way.</p>
			<p><strong class="text-black">Did you know that starting in October 2017, the Google Chrome browser will start to display the words “Not Secure” in the address bar for any web page with a form on it? That just might scare away some potential business!</strong></p>
			<h2 class="section-pad" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500">We Perform Your<br><span class="blue">Software Updates</span></h2>
			<p>Anyone who has ever had or managed a WordPress site will tell you that no matter how often they update there always seems to be a pending update: core, theme or plugin. These WordPress updates often bring enhanced capabilities or better performance, but more importantly they often bring security updates. <strong class="text-black">In fact, the best method to keep your WordPress website secure is to keep it up to date. We do this for you.</strong></p>
			<p>On a regular basis and never less than once per week we will log into your site and run all pending updates. Actually, it’s not that cavalier. We first take a full backup of your website as it is before we start the updates. This is of course in addition to the two other automated daily backups we take. </p>
			<p>Once the backup is confirmed to be successful we then perform pending updates and manually review and test the site. If an issue is found we will try and work through it; or if we can’t quickly resolve it, we will roll the update or entire site back to what it was pre-update. We’ll then contact you with the issue and go over options with you.</p>
			<h2 class="section-pad"  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500">Access to a<br><span class="blue">WordPress Support Team</span></h2>
			<p>FatLab is not actually a web hosting company. <strong>FatLab is a website support company.</strong> We are WordPress experts that specialize in supporting currently built websites. With the exception of some unique agency partnerships, we do not build or design websites, we simply support them. Part of providing the best support possible is building and maintaining the best possible hosting infrastructure possible, this is what puts us into the Wordpress hosting business.</p>
			<p><strong class="text-black">Our team consists of web developers with well over a decade of development experience that specialize in working on sites built by other people (this is seriously a skill that not all developers have).</strong></p>
			<p>We have a dedicated support ticket system to track all open issues and keep a complete account record. You are also welcome to call or email us. We are happy to answer questions, consult on best practices,  and help enhance your site with new features or by improving old features.</p>
