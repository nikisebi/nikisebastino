				<h2>We squash bugs</h2>
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">White screen of death? No worries, we got it.</h4>
				<p>Whether it be a glaring error message ("fatal error" sounds so scary, doesn't it?) or a small annoyance to usability or administration, we can fix it. We'll dig through server logs, test the front-end, evaluate the back-end and we will find that bug and squash it.</p>
				<p>Software bugs can crop up when you least expect it. They can be introduced with a software update, new browser release, or in untested/unexpected use-case, and they need to be taken care of immediately. They need to be taken care before they have a negatively impact the usability of your site.</p>
				<p>This is where we come in. We remain on call to deal with any web support issue that comes up. We'll identify the circumstance that triggers the bug and resolve it as soon as possible.</p>

				<h2>We enhance websites</h2>
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">The time for change is now.</h4>
				<p>A website that never changes is a boring website! You have customers, members, constituents, donors, and visitors of all kinds - and they all expect a smooth experience from your website. To provide that experience, you need to keep that site up to date. This could be as simple as regular content updates, or as complex as adding new features and functions to enhance your user's experience.</p>
				<p>We'll help you identify the best method to deliver your website visitors the content and services they need, and we will work with you over time to keep your website growing and improving.</p>

				<h2>We solve problems</h2>
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">We'll get the monkey off your back.</h4>
				<p>Solving problems is our core job. In fact Shane's elevator pitch for FatLab is "We make people's problems go away". Of course, he is only talking about website problems. That said, he is not opposed to providing some unlicensed therapy. (Same guarantees do not apply).</p>
				<p>The majority of our clients come to us because they have identified a problem and are having trouble fixing it because they don't have the technical expertise to get it resolved.</p>
				<p>We can solve your problems. Whether it be the need for a new feature, problems with up-time and performance, software bugs or limitation to your site - regardless of the initial reason you contact us, our job does not change. Quite simply, as a web support company, it is our job to solve your (website) problems.</p>

				<p>Our team has consulted with organizations and individuals of all kinds. Our clients range from small business owners, Fortune 500 companies, trade and issue based associations, foreign governments, domestic agencies, communications firms, members of congress and many more.</p>

				<h2>Software updates</h2>
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">Does the thought of hosing your site scare you? Let us handle the updates.</h4>
				<p>With our WordPress maintenance plans we will log into your site regularly (minimum once per week), create a manual backup of both files and database, and perform all pending WordPress core, plugin and theme updates.</p>
				<p>After we complete the updates we will test the site to ensure all is well. If issues are noted, we immediately evaluate the issue, fix it, or if it's not a quick fix roll the site back to stable state. We will then contact you to develop a solution.</p>
				<p>Regular software updates are typically included as one of the very first bullet points in any article on keeping your WordPress website secure. We agree and take care of this task for you.</p>

				<p>Let's be honest, there is no such thing as a "secure website". There is only a website that has all reasonable steps taken to ensure that it is protected against known threats. It is also important to know what to do if your site should fall victim to attack.

When that happens, you wonder how long the situation has been present, how many customers have you lost, have you missed an important opportunity, and what the cumulative damage will be.</p>
				<p>We help make sure this situation never occurs. We monitor your site from 180 testing nodes in 42 geographic locations in 28 countries. </p>
				<p>We test your website every 5 minutes 24/7/365 for performance and up/down status. If any irregularity is noted, a member of our team will receive an alert and will investigate and begin remediation immediately.</p>

				<h2>Full Service Managed WordPress Hosting</h2>
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">We really geek out about doing Managed Wordpress Hosting right.</h4>
				<p>We have redefined what Managed WordPress Hosting means!</p>
				<p>A typical managed hosting plan includes some security, maybe some automated software updates and some performance enhancement services. What's missing? Custom configuration for you unique site. If your hosting company states they do managed hosting we encourage you to ask if their support is limited to their hosting platform or if they offer custom configuration for your specific website.</p>
				<p>This is where FatLab Managed Wordpress Hosting is different. We provide you with a great hosting platform AND we support your unique website. </p>
				<p>We get to know your site, what plugins are in use, your trouble points are, and what issues you have experienced. We'll never tell you to contact a developer or that something is not our problem. <span class="text-black">If you have a problem, we have a problem, and it's our job to fix it.</span></p>
				<p>To FatLab, Managed WordPress Hosting means we take care of every part of your website and there are no excuses.</p>

				<h5 class="sans-serif">When you host with FatLab you can rest easy with the knowledge that someone has their eyes on your site 24/7/365.</h5>
				<p>We test each site under our various website maintenance and hosting plans every 5 minutes for performance and up/down issues. This is done from over 180 testing nodes in 28 countries. When an issue is detected we immediately verify the issue from other geographic locations. If an issue is confirmed an alert will be sent to us, and we immediately begin working to resolve the problem.</p>
				<p>Monitoring your specific site is really what makes us unique. All hosts will monitor their servers (or at least they should). We do that too. We monitor our entire infrastructure from multiple points/systems and raise an alert if anything is wrong. From high CPU rates to crashed servers we know immediately and our 24/7/365 dedicated server team is on it.</p>
				<p>The best thing? You and your visitors probably won’t even know if we have a server issue thanks to our load balanced redundant web hosting system. Our systems have been engineered with redundancy so that servers can go down but your site will remain up and running without a hitch.</p>

				<h2>Real time web security</h2>
				<p>Every site hosted by FatLab is protected by a real-time firewall. This is not a plugin but an active service that scans all traffic to your website, and stops bad traffic before it even touches your website and our servers. Our firewall helps protect against</p>

			<h2>Performance focused</h2>
			<section class="col-sm-6 section-pad-right-large">
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">CDN (Content distribution network)</h4>
				<p>All FatLab hosting plans utilize a CDN.  A CDN keeps copies of static assets (images, PDFs, CSS and JavaScript) from your site on servers placed all over the world. And then these servers distribute your files from the closest geographic location to the site visitor. This can greatly increase the speed of your website.</p>
				<p>And did you know Google and other search engines calculate load times in their ranking algorithm? So a fast site can increase your Google page ranking AND improve user experience.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="col-sm-6">
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">Full page caching</h4>
				<p>What if our web server didn't have to work so hard to build your page each and every time it was requested by a site visitor? Your site would be faster, that's what.</p>
				<p>We have the ability to cache full pages and store those pages on a CDN for super fast delivery. If you make a change, clearing your cache is easy using the admin area of your site, and dynamic pages can be made exempt from caching. This is another benefit of the custom configuration of FatLab Managed Hosting.</p>
				<p>Full page caching can be a great performance booster for your website! We can consult with you on the best caching strategy to balance performance with ease of administration and use.</p>
