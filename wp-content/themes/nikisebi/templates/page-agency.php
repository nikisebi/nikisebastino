		<p>We understand what it is like to try and provide quality support to your clients while remaining focused on larger projects and campaigns.</p>
		<p>That's why we provide support, hosting & WordPress development. Juggling resources and the expense of moving time away from other deliverables is a tough challenge. This is where we come in.</p>
		<p>FatLab can provide a dedicated web support desk and custom build services so that your team can remain focused on larger deliverables. </p>
		<p class="sans-serif text-orange">We bill at a rate that you can mark up, and we can either work directly with your client or through you. Regardless, the client remains yours and it is our job to make you look good.</p>

				<h3 class="sans-serif text-orange">Website support services</h3>
				<p>Let us be your website maintenance and support department. We understand that campaigns are your business and letâ€™s face it, web support sucks when you are trying to focus on the big picture.</p>
				<p>Web support may be something that becomes part of the job, but not necessarily a profit center. Pulling your top developers, designers or even account execs away from larger projects to work on individual support requests can be costly and can negatively impact project deadlines. </p>
				<p class="sans-serif text-black">This is where we come in. We want to be your dedicated support department.</p>

				<h3 class="sans-serif text-orange">Reliable website hosting</h3>
				<p>Servers and hosting infrastructure is not what your business is about. However, you run campaigns, design websites, and manage client communications - which means you have sites and assets to host.
				<p>Worrying about whether your client's site is up, secure, and at optimal performance is not where your focus should be. When there is a problem, calling a large hosting company and dealing with the hassle of waiting for a rep, or getting a rep who's not able to give good advice is not a good use of your time.</p>
				<p class="sans-serif text-black">FatLab takes care of all this for you. We have experience hosting campaigns and websites of all sizes and we have hosting partnerships with agencies who need to provide enterprise level solutions but do not want to be in the hosting business.</p>

				<h3 class="sans-serif text-orange">You plan it, you design it, we build it</h3>
				<p>It's a bit of a secret but FatLab does in fact build websites. But don't tell our direct clients as it is a service we offer only to our agency partners.</p>
				<p>You're the brains of the operation and we are here support you. Provide the information architecture, site plan, and design files and we'll bring your vision to reality. We can consult along the way, and we will be sure you deliver a great product to your client.</p>
				<p class="sans-serif text-black">We have developed dozens of sites for organizations of all kinds - including many household brand names - through our agency partnerships. From micro-sites, custom applications, to full primary websites we work behind the scenes and you can consider us as a member of your team.</p>
