					<h2>FatLab Web Support</h2>
					<p>Founded by <a href="#shane">Shane Larrabee</a>, a web development veteran of over 17 years, <span class="text-black">FatLab is a website maintenance company focused on providing the absolute best client support experience.</span> We’re on-call to handle systems monitoring, security patches, upgrades, bug fixes, site enhancements, content updates and many more website maintenance services.</p>
					<p>FatLab will not try to sell you a new website. We keep  sites up and running so your business is up and running.  Our focus is why we are able to support you and your site more efficiently and more effectively than our competitors.</p>
					<p>FatLab uses a robust online web support ticket system for clients to create and track support requests 24/7/365. In addition, each of our clients is served by a primary account manager.</p>

					<h3 class="sans-serif">A Virginia, USA Company</h3>
					<p class="text-black">Washington, DC for you politically oriented folks</p>
					<p>FatLab is a registered Limited Liability Company (LLC) in the state of Virginia and was founded in downtown Washington, DC. We have a 100% American talent pool. Our client base extends through the United States and Canada with about 70% of our clients being based in the major business centers of the East Coast: New York, Baltimore, DC, Atlanta and Miami. We can put on a tie and meet in the board rooms of K Street or sport shorts and a fleece (when it’s 50 degrees and raining) and meet over a cup of coffee in Seattle. Then again, we could just meet online and get some work done… your call.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 class="sans-serif">A Small Company with BIG Infrastructure</h4>
					<p>FatLab has partnered with Rackspace, Inc. as our data and infrastructure provider. All FatLab dedicated infrastructure is held in a Managed Operations account within the Dallas, TX Rackspace Data Center where systems are monitored 24/7/365 by a dedicated engineering team. Rackspace provides us everything from redundant internet/network connections, backups, physical security, uninterruptible power, network security, server patching and much more. While many companies like ours lease a shared VPS and load their clients up on a budget plan, we have made some large investments into redundant and secure hosting solutions for our clients.</p>

				<p>FatLab is proud to have all American talent, i.e. we’re not sending your work overseas for a markup.</p>
				<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange" >No Cubicles Here</h4>
				<p>FatLab has taken a unique approach to building a team and work environment. The goal being: Let’s prove this “internet thing”. We live in a world where our Alexandria, VA office number is answered in Michigan and then transferred to the appropriate person whether they be in Washington, DC, Virginia, Costa Rica or Mexico. We work East Coast business hours but that doesn’t always mean we are on the East Coast. From centralized code repositories, ticket systems, video chats and VOIP phone systems, we have built a system that allow us to work from wherever we are AND wherever you are. This whole “internet thing” may just actually work.</p>
