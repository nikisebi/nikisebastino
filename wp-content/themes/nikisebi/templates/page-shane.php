			<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">Why are you here?</h4>
			<p>I founded FatLab, LLC because after well over a decade in the web development industry I sensed a void. It seemed that you couldn’t throw a rock without hitting someone who said they knew how to build a website and tools like WordPress and Drupal allow even non-programmers to launch sophisticated websites. However, general support and client service were lacking. Too many times I heard complaints that agencies made website maintenance a low priority service or freelancers couldn’t be reached post launch. With this in mind I launched FatLab Web Support in late 2010 as a client service focused company, looking to great customer/client service companies as Disney, Starbucks, AmericanExpress and Rackspace for inspiration.</p>
			<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">Remember AOL 5.25 floppies?</h4>
			<p>I do and in fact my adventure began well before AOL filled our (snail) mailbox with 5.25 floppy disks, when getting online meant looking up a phone number in local BBS directory and ‘high speed’ was 14.4 BAUD.</p>
			<h4 class="sans-serif text-orange">Another introvert geek coder, huh?</h4>
			<p>Not really. Despite this fascination with computers and technology, I was more interested in how technology could be used in marketing and communications. My career began amongst large and mid-sized PR and marketing firms including Ogilvy PR (Washington, DC) , Brodeur (Boston, MA) and The Hoffman Agency (San Jose, CA). Working for the agencies gave me great experience working with people and companies. The question was always: How can we use web technology to meet business and communication goals?</p>

			<p>In 2003 I launched Larrabee Interactive Business Communications, LLC (Larrabee IBC) after leaving the agencies. Based in Washington, DC, this was a consultancy focused on working with trade and issue based organizations and commercial businesses on developing their online presence and interactive communications strategies. Larrabee IBC was acquired by Project BIG fish, a Washington, DC based design studio, in late 2004. I served as a partner and the Director of Technology at Project BIG fish for 6 years.</p>
			<p>In 2010, prior to launching FatLab I served as the Director of Client Service for Blue Water Media, A Washington, DC based interactive firm focused on providing interactive solutions to private businesses and the federal agencies.</p>
